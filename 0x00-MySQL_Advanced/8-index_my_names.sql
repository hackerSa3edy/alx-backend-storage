-- This SQL script creates an index named `idx_name_first` on the `names` table.
-- The index is created on the first character of the `name` column.
-- Indexing the first character can improve query performance for searches that filter by the initial character of the `name`.
CREATE INDEX `idx_name_first` ON `names` (`name`(1));
